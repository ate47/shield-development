## SHIELD
A very experimental modification platform for Call of DutyÂ®: Black Ops 4 run by community, aiming at improving both functionality and performance of original game.


## DEMONWARE
This branch includes custom demonware server emulator built in to client. not full functionality but it handles pretty much everything required to get game running.


## INSTRUCTION
1- clone repository with its sub-modules and use generate.bat to make visual studio solution then compile project and copy ``d3d11.dll`` into your bo4 folder.

2- check and see if you have lpc files needed to play online under LPC folder in your game directory. there should be 12 items + 1 manifest; you should have them by default from original game but if its not there its fine you can get them [HERE](https://github.com/project-bo4/shield-development/raw/demonware/assets/bo4_tu23_639_cf92ecf4a75d3f79_lpc.zip)
